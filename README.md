<p>
Most of my projects are private because they’re <b>closed-source</b>. That includes startup code, tools I built for myself, and experiments I’m not ready to share yet. Some of them handle sensitive data, and some are part of bigger products I’m still working on.
</p>

<p>
If you’re curious about what I’ve built, or wanna collaborate, just DM me. I’ve got demos, writeups, and code I can share privately.
</p>

<p>
I’m also into cognitive science, neuroscience, and how tech can be used to build better tools for different kinds of minds. It’s a long-term goal. For now, I’m just putting in the reps and building the foundation.
