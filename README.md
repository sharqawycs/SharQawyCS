<h1 align="center">Yo, I'm Sharqawy (aka CS)</h1>

<p align="center"><i>This GitHub looks empty? That’s on purpose.</i></p>

<p>
I’m a software engineering student who builds aggressively and posts selectively. Most of the real stuff I’m working on is <b>closed-source</b>. Not because it's bad — but because I don’t believe every line of code belongs in public. I'm building internal tools, startup products, or things I might ship later, and I don’t owe GitHub green squares for that.
</p>

<p>
What I care about is simple: clean architecture, minimal UI, fast performance, and solving real problems with code. I’m not here to impress with trendy libraries or fake side-projects. I’m here to ship, learn, and get better.
</p>

<p>
My stack is mostly <b>JavaScript, C++, C#, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Node.js</b>, with some <b>Docker, Appwrite, Supabase, Linux</b> thrown in. I build full-stack apps, but I focus heavily on backend logic, clean structure, and developer experience.
</p>

<p>
You’ll find a few public repos here — mostly small utilities, UI tests, or projects I kept for memory. But most of my serious work lives in private repos. If you’re curious about what I’ve built, or wanna collaborate, just DM me. I’ve got demos, writeups, and code I can share privately.
</p>

<p>
I’m also into cognitive science, neurodiversity, and how tech can be used to build better tools for different kinds of minds. It’s a long-term goal. For now, I’m just putting in the reps and building the foundation.
